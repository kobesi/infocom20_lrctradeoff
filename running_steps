Preparation: 
  In each datanode, the directory for storing the code is "/home/jhli/WUSI/lrctradeoff/", 
  and the directory for storing the data is "/home/jhli/WUSI/lrctradeoff/data/".


Example topology:
  Coordinator: node12,
  Datanodes: node2, node3, node4, node5 --> rack1;
             node14, node15, node16 --> rack2;
             virtual node --> virtual rack (for storing the global parity blocks, but we don't have to store the global parity blocks in our experiments).
  Gateway: node18.


Example coding parameters:
  k = 4, l = 2, g = 2 --> k = 4, l' = 1, g = 2.

Example placement method:
  Opt-S.


Running:
1. In the coordinator (CN), e.g., node12, running "./dist.sh", copy the code to the datanodes (DN);

2. In CN, generate a file named "WS0000" with size 64*4 MB;

3. In CN, running "./LRCCN";

4. In each of DN, running "./LRCDN";

5. In CN, inputting "ul WS0000/ dl WS0000/ uc WS0000/ dc WS0000" to test the performance of upload/ download/ upcode/ downcode;

6. Or in CN, inputting "te WS0000" to test the performance of upload + download + upcode + downcode.
